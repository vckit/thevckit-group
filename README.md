### BasFox
#### Description
The BasFox project allowed me to become familiar with the SwiftUI features, thanks to which I was able to draw complex geometric structures and apply them in my project
Next, I plan to implement the ability to authorize and register users using FareBase

+ **SignIn View**

+ **SignUp View**

### Auth App
#### Description
In Auth App, I implemented the ability to authorize and register using Firebase, we have a small layout and work with the logic of the application. The application also remembers the user, even if he restarts the application, the application will remain authorized

To develop the skills of working with Farebase, I would like to expand the scope of this technology and continue to develop this project

+ **Sign In**
